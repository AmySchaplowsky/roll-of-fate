#### Notes

- After a night of packing, [[Feorella]], [[Narren]], and company set off for the [[Riverlands]] and [[House Redfern]]. 
- Along the way, they met a suspicious bard who introduced himself as [[Honest]] Pliny. 
	- [[Honest]] told them about a black market where slaves were sold, including a 'Southern giant'. 
	- They parted ways at a crossroads, where the party decided to go to the black market and try to find [[Narren]]'s lost companions. 
- [[Narren]] and [[Corren]] found [[Cody]] Reins, and learned that [[Ol Levi]] was in the personal custody of the Iron Isles lieutenant in charge of the area, Black Cloud. 
- [[Feorella]] and [[Aliss]] went to seek a mercenary band to fulfill [[Mariota]]'s request. 
- They spoke with [[the Band of the Fisher Lord]], [[Hoods of the Woods]] (almost certainly double entendre), [[Iron Reavers]], and [[Company of Bravery]], leaving [[The Silent Sentinels]] for later. 
- [[Maester Vaelon]] met with a merchant who had no name. 
	- Claimed to have lost it to the Black Cloud who had magic over names. 
	- She gifts him a small pot with a Dragon's Breath flower, a reminder of his homeland. 
- A summons went out for the company of [[Feorella]] Delver (by name!) to see the Black Cloud, who was none other than the bard from before [[Honest]] Pliny.
