#### Notes

- INTRIGUE
- [[Corren]] and [[Ser Ronald]] talk about [[Ser Ronald]]'s' Suspicion of him
- [[Sophitia]] wants to send [[Feorella]] elsewhere
	- [[Feorella]] wants to go to the [[Riverlands]] to get access to Mercenary's.
- [[Aliss]] failed to find any trace of the [[Milk Snakes]]
- [[Maester Vaelon]] found several lost messages while cleaning out the rookery.
	- First was an announcement of [[Narren]]'s betrothal.
	- Second was the rescinding of that betrothal because she "had dishonored herself and the family" and was being sent to [[House Delver]] to learn how to be a lady again.
	- The third was from one [[Aegon Targaryen]] declaring his rule over the seven kingdoms (dated from ~6 months ago).
- [[Feorella]] talks her mother into sending her to the [[Riverlands]] rather than The Eyrie. 
- [[Maester Vaelon]] realizes that [[Feorella]] is manipulating her, but supports her play.
- [[Maester Vaelon]] is acting very odd--ponderous, distant, cryptic.
- [[Maester Vaelon]] decides to go with them to the [[Riverlands]] despite the overwhelming amount of work and preparations that still needs to be done in the [[Delving Vale]].
- Needs to collect new Ravens from the Houses there to be able to DM them and get news, arrange trade networks, and collect medicinal supplies that are unavailable in the [[Delving Vale]].
