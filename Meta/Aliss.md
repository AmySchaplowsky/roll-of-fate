## Backstory
Aliss Collarde is a grizzled, middle-aged woman in the service of House Delver. Well tanned from a life outdoors, she sports reddish-brown eyes and a mocking smile. Though still active in service of the household, she is starting to show some gray in her hair as well as an undeniably heavier build.

Some twenty years ago, shortly after the founding of House Delver, Lady Delver returned from a trip with a young Aliss in tow. Neither spoke of how they met, though shortly after the crude young woman was appointed to be the House's first Chief Ranger, then later Master of Game. The first thing Aliss did was take a small force into the Stonewoods to the north to clear out the bandits who had taken residence there since the fall of the previous rulers of the valley. With a deftness that startled her cadre, Aliss led the way though the twisting woods and the bandits various traps, driving out the bandits from the valley within the space of a week.

With this feat, Aliss gained a wary respect from the members of the household--a feeling that has waned in the twenty intervening years as she did little but laze about her Lady's keep, eating, drinking, and telling tall tales. Now, whispers have started that her years have caught up with her, and that she is no longer up to the job. Worse still are the few voices that question her loyalty to House Delver.
