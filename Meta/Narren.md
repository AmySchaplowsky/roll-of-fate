# Narren Drinkwater

![[Narren (Smiling).png]]

## Backstory
Daughter of Theonie Delver and Bolistair Drinkwater (and niece of Sophita Delver) Narren grew up among the nobility of Dorne. House Drinkwater's control of fertile lands around a beautiful oasis in the desert affords them a wealthy living.  Narren was doted on by her parents and practically raised like a princess.  

So when her family decided to send her away to her family in the Vale "for her own good", she didn't think she could be more mortified.  Thanks to stories she'd been told about surly, violent North Folk, eternal winter's cold, and marauding tribes of cannibals climbing over The Wall, Narren believed she was being sent to her death.

Deciding to show her parents that they couldn't break her so easily, Narren accepted the challenge of enduring this "punishment" with her head held high... but fate was determined to make the transition more difficult than she could have expected.

  

Short, thin, and unfamiliar with a harder life, Narren is more likely to be mistaken as a child among the people of the Vale, than as the young woman with a head full of books and the excellent teachings of House Drinkwater's Maester, Thaise. Starting at a young age, Narren happily followed her Maester everywhere, soaking up as much knowledge as she could; medicine being her favorite subject.
